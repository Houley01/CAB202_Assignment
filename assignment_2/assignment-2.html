                In this assignment you will design, implement, and test, a simple interactive game called Asteroid
                Apocalypse
                which will run on the QUT TeensyPewPew device. Game functionality will be accessed via hardware controls
                connected to the Teensy, and also via character sequences received via USB serial connector.

            <h2>Exciting introduction</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In this game you control a starfighter which must defend the Earth from a catastrophic asteroid
                    swarm.
                    Asteroids enter the playfield at the top of the LCD display, and travel generally downwards. The
                    starfighter
                    is equipped with a potent plasma cannon mounted in a turret in its nose. When fired, this emits a
                    coherent
                    packet of highly energetic plasma (a plasma bolt) which travels in straight line from the launch
                    point. The
                    plasma cannon covers a 120-degree forward arc (i.e. in front of the starfighter), with default
                    firing
                    direction straight ahead. You can fire plasma bolts by aiming the turret at any point within the
                    forward
                    arc. When a plasma bolt hits an asteroid, the asteroid splits to form two boulders. Boulders
                    continue to
                    move downwards, at a new (different) oblique angle. When a plasma bolt strikes a boulder, the
                    boulder splits
                    to form two fragments, which in turn continue to move downwards at new oblique angles. The
                    starfighter is
                    protected by a deflector shield which extends horizontally across the display just in front of it.
                    When the
                    deflector shield is touched by an object (asteroid, boulder, or fragment), the object is immediately
                    destroyed but the shield takes damage. Eventually, cumulative damage weakens the shield and the
                    starfighter
                    is destroyed by intense ionising radiation released as the shield collapses.</p>

                    <li><strong>Game time and Game start:</strong> the game time is derived from one of the Teensy's
                        on-board
                        timers and is incremented at approximately 1 second intervals.
                        The game time starts when the user releases the program from pause mode. At that time, status
                        information is sent to the computer along with a "game started" message.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Game pause:</strong> the game is paused by pressing Joystick Center or <code>'p'</code>.
                        When
                        the game is paused the game time stops incrementing. To resume, Joystick Center or
                        <code>'p'</code> is
                        pressed again.</li>

            <h2>Program structure, implementation quality</h2>
            <p>As is always the case, the program must be implemented with a view to ease of comprehension and
                maintainability.
                To this end:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The program should be subdivided into loosely coupled functions. Wherever possible and practical,
                    data is
                    transferred between functions via parameters and return values rather than shared global variables.
                </li>
                <li>No function may contain more than 25 executable C language instructions. Note that comma-separated
                    expressions with side effects will be classified as multiple executable instructions.</li>
                <li>No function may be substantially identical to any other function.</li>
                <li>All functions have carefully and meaningfully narrated documentation comments.</li>
                <li>All source code must be formatted in a professional manner, making sensible use of meaningful
                    identifiers,
                    and adhering to a consistent coding standard of your choice.</li>
                <li>Groups of related functions should be sectioned out into separate modules. Use of global variables
                    is
                    restricted to the compilation unit within which it is declared.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Provide a set of user instructions which tell the user how to execute a list of tests
                    to rigorously and methodically cover all items of functionality.
                </p>
                <p>Each test must be documented in the plain text document referred to under the heading "Deliverables",
                    using
                    short paragraphs to address:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What item of functionality (from the numbered list above) the test covers.</li>
                    <li>What the expected outcome from running the test should be.</li>
                    <li>What the behaviour observed in your program is.</li>
                    <li>A list of user inputs which can be entered via Putty (or your chosen terminal program) or
                        carried out
                        manually via the hardware controls attached to the TeensyPewPew.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A template text document will be published as a tutorial resource during Week 11. Failure to provide
                    a
                    correctly will result in a score of 0 for this section.</p>

            <h2>Marking</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The assignment is worth 40% of your total grade in this subject, and it is marked out of 30. A
                    detailed
                    marking rubric will be published in Blackboard Grade Centre at least 7 <span
                        style="text-decoration: line-through">14</span> days before the submission deadline.
                    The approximate breakdown of marks will be:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functionality: 25 marks.</li>
                    <li>Testing: 10 marks.</li>
                    <li>Program structure, implementation quality: 5 marks. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;The following points should be noted about marking:

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>If your code does not compile when submitted to AMS, the mark awarded will be
                            0.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Give yourself plenty of time to get the basics right.</li>
                            <li>Submit Early. Submit Often.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>If the program has been implemented via a framework other than the CAB202 Teensy library
                            without
                            <span class="auto-style1">prior written permission from the Unit Coordinator</span>, the
                            mark
                            awarded will be 0.</strong></li>
                    <li>If the program locks up or produces other untoward brick-like behaviour, marks will be awarded
                        for the
                        features that were observed prior to the point at which the game ceased to operate.

                        <ul>
                            <li>No effort will be made to work around the crash, nor will we debug your code to make it
                                compile
                                or run.</li>
                            <li>“It runs fine on my computer!” may be true, but it is largely irrelevant if the program
                                crashes
                                when executed on another machine. Such an excuse will not be accepted.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>It is your responsibility to implement each feature sufficiently well that it is readily
                        detected
                        through normal operation of the game. Any feature that is not apparent through normal play will
                        be
                        deemed to be unimplemented. </li>
                    <li>We require tutors to adhere to a strict time limit of 3 minutes run time when marking each
                        submission.
                        Any feature that cannot be assessed in that time will be deemed to be unimplemented. Therefore
                        you must
                        avoid defects in game dynamics such as extremely fast motion, extremely slow motion,
                        inconsistent
                        control settings, premature program termination, or other properties that render the game unfit
                        for use.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is better to implement some of the features extremely well than to try to do everything and
                        deliver a
                        substandard product.</li>
                    <li>Penalties will be applied if the code exhibits general defects or undesirable behaviour not
                        otherwise
                        covered in this document. This includes but is not limited to such things as:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Errors in object motion, such as objects jumping more than one character position per

                    <p>Source files for each submission will be placed in a single distinct folder on the server, and
                        compiled
                        with the following command:</p>

                    <p>Therefore, you should organise your files in a folder alongside the <code>cab202_teensy</code>
                        folder and
                        use this command to build your solution. Make sure there are no additional files (such as old
                        versions
                        of your program) in your work folder to prevent unpredictable build errors due to inclusion of
                        incorrect
                        versions of files.</p>

                    <p>If compilation is successful, AMS will verify that your program has compiled successfully and
                        return.
                        Your program will <em>not</em> be executed because there is no meaningful test that can be
                        performed
                        automatically on a program such as this.</p>

                    <p>The transcript will contain a copy of the compiled <code>.hex</code> file. You can paste this
                        into a text
                        document (using notepad++ or a Linux-compatible text editor) and save it as a <code>*.hex</code>
                        file
                        for local testing.</p>
